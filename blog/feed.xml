&lt;h3&gt;What is Oh My Zsh?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer the zsh official gitgub repository for more details like installation and configurations
&lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zsh by default comes with lots of themes.
Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just the right one (for him).
Once you find a theme that you'd like to use, you will need to edit the ~/.zshrc file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;ZSH_THEME=&quot;robbyrussell&quot;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme.&lt;br /&gt;For example:&lt;kbd&gt;ZSH_THEME=&quot;ziabs&quot;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing ziabs zsh theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the theme (ziabs.zsh-theme) file to your zsh theme folder (~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ziabs-code overflow-auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;samp&gt;wget --directory-prefix=/home/${USER}/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ziabs/ziabs-zsh-theme/master/ziabs.zsh-theme&lt;/samp&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update your ZSH_THEME in the &lt;kbd&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/kbd&gt; (ZSH_THEME=ziabs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ziabs-code&quot;&gt;&lt;samp&gt;source ~/.zshrc&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we are going to discuss how to change the user password in Linux. The instructions given below can work on any Linux distribution. The passwd command is used to update or change the user’s password.There are two types of users; normal users, and the root user. The normal user can only change his account password but superuser i.e. root can change the password of itself as well as of any user account present in the Linux operating system.&lt;br /&gt;Let’s discuss the guidelines to changing password.&lt;br /&gt;
  To change a password of a user, first sign on to the &quot;root&quot; account.&lt;br /&gt;
  Example: &lt;kbd&gt;su root&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
  Then type : &lt;kbd&gt;passwd USER-NAME&lt;/kbd&gt;
  Where `USER-NAME` is the &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; for the password you are changing.&lt;br /&gt;
  Now the system will prompt you to Enter new UNIX password , and  Retype new UNIX password.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	You can also change your own password, by typing &lt;kbd&gt;passwd&lt;/kbd&gt; (without specifying a username). You will be prompted to enter your old password for verification, and then a new password.

Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil? the simple man whose karma re-cast him as our Mahadev, the God of Gods Today .

His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain.The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs – Shiva’s philosopher guides – betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems.Fierce battles will be fought.
